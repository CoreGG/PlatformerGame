First the player choose to play by clicking one of the options in the features menu.
The slot machine plays and the result appears first as big win(which is the default "win" result)
Then as it calculates the profit, the profit grows larger and exceed the limit of "Mega Win" which is 30.0, so it shows "Mege Win" instead.
Then the profit grows over 60.0 so the win now exceed the limit of "Super Win" which is showed on the screen.
Finally, the game highlights the slots final result in each row.

I would improve the flow by changing the speed of the profit increasement randomly in certain patterns.
For example faking a slow down phase(which usually means we are close to the finish) to create suspense and surprise.
